# WeatherMan
Demo Project that displays weather forecasts from the NOAA REST APIs in swift for iOS

This project is part of my swift learning experience. It simply uses the NOAA REST APIs at http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/rest.php to download the weather forecast for a specified  zip code and then displays the results in a table view.

## To Do

* Add a better first view in the Table to show the zip code and Geographic name, and maybe the lat/long of the location.
* Get the geographic name for the zipcode, from a database or I think Google has a REST API for this.
